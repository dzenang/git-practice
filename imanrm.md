### What is a branch
When you make a new branch you are taking the current version of code and making some new changes. You can sync between your branch and main branch using merge.

### What is a pull request
Pull Requests are specific requests to merge changes from one branch into another, often for code review and integration before merging.

### What is a fork in GitHub
It's making a copy of a Repository to your account. It's an isolated copy from the original one so anything we do will not update the original one and vice versa.
