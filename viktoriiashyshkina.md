### What is the branch

Branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot 
of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how 
small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.

### What is a pull request
Pull requests let you tell others about 
changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.


### What is a fork in GitHub

A fork is a new repository that shares code 
and visibility settings with the original “upstream" repository.
