## Branch

It is a place where one can edit some files from a project. 
These files will  be merged to a main branch, as soon as they are finished.

## Pull request

If you finished updating a file and want to send it to Github (and merge it to the main branch), 
you need to make a pull request. 

## Fork in Github

It is like cloning a repo, but on Github.
